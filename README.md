Hi! My name is Victor, and I write tools for IT and security teams. For work, I help manage the fleet of Macs at Google.

I'm *wikiwalk* on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wikiwalk). You can follow or contact me there.

My most active project is [MicroMDM](https://micromdm.io). I am building [v2](https://github.com/micromdm/micromdm/tree/v2dev).

My favorite language is [Go](https://go.dev/) and I'm on a journey to learn [Swift](https://swift.org/).
